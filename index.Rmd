# State of the hexapod tree of life

```{r summary, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
loadd(taxa_df)
```

We are planning to gather info on `r length(taxa_df$Family)` families.

The code for these analyses is all in https://github.com/bomeara/hexapods. The ROpenSci package `drake` is used to dynamically run analyses to generate content (including this page).

## Funding

The core grant for this was NSF [FuturePhy grant ID]. Participation and tools was also supported by grants [GN], [Phylotastic], [more]
